Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering in ML Project 
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics. In this ML project, we used K-Means clustering to segment customers into meaningful clusters. 
What is K-Means Clustering? 
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into K clusters. The algorithm iteratively updates the centroids of the clusters to minimize the sum of squared distances between the data points and their assigned centroids. 
How did we apply K-Means Clustering? 
We used a dataset containing customer information, including purchase history, age, income, and location. We preprocessed the data by scaling and normalizing the features. Then, we applied K-Means clustering to segment the customers into 5 clusters (K=5). 
What were the results? 
The K-Means clustering algorithm grouped customers into 5 distinct clusters:
1. Young Professionals: High-income, urban customers with a high purchase frequency.
2. Families: Middle-aged, suburban customers with a moderate purchase frequency.
3. Retirees: Low-income, rural customers with a low purchase frequency.
4. Students: Low-income, urban customers with a high purchase frequency.
5. High-Value Customers: High-income, urban customers with a very high purchase frequency.
Benefits of Customer Segmentation:
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering helps businesses:
1. Target specific customer groups: Tailor marketing campaigns to specific segments.
2. Improve customer retention: Offer personalized services to retain high-value customers.
3. Increase sales: Identify cross-selling and upselling opportunities.
Conclusion :
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering is a powerful technique for businesses to understand their customers better. By grouping customers into meaningful clusters, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to specific segments, improving customer retention and increasing sales.
